# Security Policy for IE Bank Infrastructure 

## Introduction
This document delineates the security procedures and policies governing the IE Infrastructure. 
Our aim is to outline a comprehensive approach to handle security vulnerabilities and to offer clear guidelines for contributors and users alike, 
ensuring the integrity and safety of the project. 
As part of our commitment to robust security, we have integrated advanced practices and tools, 
including GitHub's Advanced Security features such as CodeQL for semantic code analysis and Dependabot for dependency management.

Should you identify a potential security vulnerability within our project, we urge you to report it promptly. 
Our dedicated team is committed to addressing security concerns with utmost urgency and discretion. 
We strive to acknowledge and respond to security reports within a 72-hour window. For the reporting process, please follow the guidelines detailed in the subsequent sections.

  
## Security-Related Configuration 
We encourage users and team members to adhere to specific security-related configurations to enhance the project's overall security. 
Detailed instructions and guidelines for secure configurations are available to team members and contributors upon request. 
These guidelines are crafted to align with our overarching security protocols and best practices.

## Known Security Gaps & Future Enhancements
We acknowledge the dynamic nature of software security and recognize the possibility of existing vulnerabilities. 
Our team is actively engaged in:

- Continuously monitoring and assessing the code for vulnerabilities.
- Implementing timely updates and patches to address known issues.
- Future enhancements will focus on strengthening our security infrastructure and expanding our vulnerability detection capabilities.

## Acknowledgments
